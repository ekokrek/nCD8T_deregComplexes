# nCD8T_deregComplexes
deregulated protein complex analysis in naive CD8+ T cells to test age and disease factor
\n\n

prepareComplexes.sh takes cellTypes.txt file and calls three python scripts: /n
	1. analysis_1.py \n
	generating condition-specific h5ad files; \n
	2. analysis_2.py \n
	generating condition-specific individual expression files \n
	3. analysis_3.py \n
	generating condition-specific ppins, ddins and predicting protein complexes \n
